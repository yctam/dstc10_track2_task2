This directory contains scripts and binary to generate confusion networks from N-best lists, and finally generate the word confusion pairs which will be used in ../pkl/noref. I put a version in pkl/noref/confusion_pairs.txt combining confusion
networks from task 1.

You can run the DO script in bash:

> bash DO
